# Global Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a Global Weather Data dashboard. It allows you to search for any city in the world and will pull in its current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast. The dashboard saves your searches so that you can easily pull the information back up when you need to access it again. Just click on the name of the city you want to see again and it will pull it out of your local storage on your browser!

Uses the following API's and CSS Extensions

- OpenWeather - https://openweathermap.org/ - For weather data
- FontAwesome - https://fontawesome.com/ - For Icons
- MomentJS - https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - For timekeeping
- Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/ - For managing CSS

## TODO

- There is a bug with creating an unexpected token in the LocalStorage on chrome. I have an error handler for it, so it doesn't break anything, but does leave a console error. Ran out of time resolving it.
